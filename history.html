    <h1>1945</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>While in the midst of World War 2, the Government House erected by Don Marcelo was temporarily converted to a hospital for injured Japanese soldiers. But when the day of liberation gets closer, in leadership of Heneral Gandecio Vera, the Government House was burned and destroyed. After the day of Liberation, 

        Don Juan Tabien became the next Mayor of Barangay Magsaysay. Don Juan and Heneral Vera proposed a High School and Hospital to be built. With the help of Gov. Santayana and Sen. Maceda, Manuel Roxas approved the said proposal.
        
        The former Government Building was turned into a hospital, and the first chief of the hospital was Dr. Jose Alonzo Jr., and the High School was erected on an eight hectares of land in front of Calle National and the Hospital. The first principal of the school was Mr. Diego Manza.</p>

        <h1>1951</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The Hospital went bankrupt. But with the help of President Ramon Magsaysay, the hospital went back to business, and the hospital is now named Magsaysay Memorial Hospital. The next chief of the hospital is Dr. Cesar Flores.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>1947-1963</h1>

            The Bagong Bayan pushed and convinced the sangguniang nayon ng dalagan that the location where the Hospital and High School will be claimed as part of the Bagong Bayan. It was agreed upon and was lead by the Tiniente Felimon Esclito.
            
            Bagong Bayan claimed a total of 30 hectares of land, where the current Magsaysay Memorial Hospital and Don Emilio Salumbides School can be found. 
            
            Since then Bagong Bayan was called as the Barangay Magsaysay, it's also called as it is for remebering the Former President, Ramon Magsaysay</p>
